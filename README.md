This repository contains a small modification of http://physics.bu.edu/py502/lectures4/examples/graphwavepacket.f90) 
to illustrate basic Principles of Quantum Mechanics according to J. J. Tanner, J. Chem. Educa- tion 67, 917 (1990).

Inside you will find three PDFs files containing a short presentation (both in English and German) with their corresponding 
NOTES, which was presented to the public on the 20 April 2024 during the Open Day of the Max Planck Institute for Solid State 
Research (Heisenbergstr. 1, 70569-D Stuttgart, Germany).

The directory QM_Principles conatins the associated codes (F90) to simulate the propagation of a Gaussian wave packet in both,
an Harmonic and a Double Well Potentials. The executable PROPAGATE takes the arguments from the text files wavepacket (containing
the parameters of the Gaussian wave packet) and potential (containing the parameters defining the potential).
